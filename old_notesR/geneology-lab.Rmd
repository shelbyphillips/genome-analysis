![My condensed family tree; my mom's side of the family is from portugal and I am not able to track them all down. My grandmother doesn't know how to spell her parents names so it may not be correct spellings either. I am not in contact with my dad's side of the family but obituary's helped me get this far since they are all from Massachusetts.](genome-analysis/images/family_tree_condensed.png)
